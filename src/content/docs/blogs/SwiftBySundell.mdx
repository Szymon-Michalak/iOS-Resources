**Published:** 20 May 2018

**Authors:** John Sundell

**Tags:**  
`scripting`, `debugging`, `ui testing`
</details>

#### Key Points
- Swift provides methods to parse and utilize launch arguments for iOS app development.
- CommandLine.arguments and UserDefaults are primary APIs used to access and parse launch arguments.
- Launch arguments are valuable for debugging, UI testing, and feature flag management.
- They allow developers to modify app behavior dynamically without code changes.
- Usage of launch arguments should be contained and managed to avoid unintended behavior in release builds.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Overview of using launch arguments beyond command line tools in Swift.
- **Parsing and Usage:** Detailed explanation of CommandLine.arguments and UserDefaults for handling launch arguments.
- **Debugging and UI Testing:** Applications of launch arguments in debugging network delays, setting app states, and UI testing setup.
- **Feature Flags and Overrides:** How launch arguments facilitate feature flag overrides during development.
- **Containment and Best Practices:** Recommendations for organizing launch argument handling code to prevent accidental inclusion in production builds.
- **Conclusion:** Benefits of using launch arguments to streamline app development and testing workflows.

**Published:** 25 Mar 2018  
**Last Updated:** -

**Authors:** John Sundell

**Tags:**  
`architecture`, `feature flags`, `maintenance`
</details>

#### Key Points
- Feature flags allow gating of code based on conditions at compile or runtime.
- They enable gradual feature rollout, risk mitigation, and A/B testing.
- Types include conditional compilation, static flags, and runtime flags.
- Practical benefits include early bug detection, simplified merge conflicts, and internal feature previews.
- Runtime flags support dynamic configuration but increase complexity and testing challenges.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Introduction to the concept and benefits of feature flags.
- **Conditional Compilation:** Using compiler flags to conditionally compile code based on predefined conditions.
- **Static Flags:** Defining feature flags in code using static properties to enable/disable features.
- **Runtime Flags:** Loading flags at runtime, allowing dynamic feature configuration but complicating maintenance.
- **Applications and Examples:** Practical scenarios and examples of implementing feature flags in Swift code.
- **Conclusion:** Recap of benefits and considerations when using feature flags in Swift development.

## API Design
### Using @autoclosure when designing Swift APIs

<details>
**URL:** [Using @autoclosure when designing Swift APIs](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/using-autoclosure-when-designing-swift-apis/)

**Published:** 28 May 2017

**Authors:** John Sundell

**Tags:**  
`language features`, `api design`
</details>

#### Key Points
- Swift‚Äôs `@autoclosure` attribute defers execution of expressions until needed.
- It simplifies API design by wrapping arguments in closures automatically.
- Examples include enhancing readability in assertions and reducing verbosity in animations and error handling.
- Enables type inference and reduces syntax clutter when dealing with default values.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Introduces the concept of `@autoclosure` in Swift, highlighting its role in deferring expression evaluation.
- **Inlining Assignments:** Shows how `@autoclosure` simplifies animation code by allowing inline expression evaluation.
- **Passing Errors as Expressions:** Demonstrates using `@autoclosure` for error handling in Swift's Optional type extensions.
- **Type Inference Using Default Values:** Explains how `@autoclosure` aids in type inference and reduces syntax in extracting values from dictionaries.
- **Conclusion:** Emphasizes the benefits of using `@autoclosure` to enhance code readability and performance.
