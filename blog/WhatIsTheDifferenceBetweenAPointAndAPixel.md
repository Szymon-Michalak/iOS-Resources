When you’re working with designers daily, it’s important to understand the difference between a point and a pixel.

As you probably know, a pixel is the smallest addressable element of your display or device.

A point is actually a measurement of length and defined as 1 / 72 of an inch. So, on a 72 PPI (pixels per inch) display one point will equal exactly one pixel.

Typically, it's used to measure the height of a font, but can be used to measure any length.
