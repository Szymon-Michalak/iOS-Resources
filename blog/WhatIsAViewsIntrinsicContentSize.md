All `UIViews` have an `.intrinsicContentSize` property that specifies the amount of space the `UIView` needs to show its content in an ideal manner.

If you've ever used `UITableView.automaticDimension`,this is deferring to the `UITableViewCell`'s intrinsic content size to figure out the appropriate height for the cell.

As another example, if you had a `UILabel` with a customfont and word wrapping enabled, the intrinsic content size would be the size needed to show all of the text without any truncation.
