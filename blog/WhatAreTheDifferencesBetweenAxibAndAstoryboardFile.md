Both a `.xib` and `.storyboard` are stored as XML filesand are both converted to binary files - `.nibs`- at compile time.

A `.xib` file usually specifies one `UIViewController` or standalone view whereas a `.storyboard` specifies a set of `UIViewControllers` and the navigation behavior between them.
