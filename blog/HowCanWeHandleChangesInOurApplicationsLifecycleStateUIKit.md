:::info[TL/DR]
Our application's `AppDelegate` allows us to handle its lifecycle changes. `UIApplication` triggers various delegate methods whenever the app's lifecycle status changes.
:::

When building an iOS application, managing its lifecycle is crucial to ensure it behaves correctly during different states such as launching, becoming active, entering the background, and terminating. The `UIApplicationDelegate` provides several methods to handle these transitions:

- **`application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`:** Called when the app is about to launch. This is the app's first opportunity to execute code.
  
- **`application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`:** Called after the app has finished launching and is ready to run. Final initialization tasks should be performed here.
  
- **`applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)`:** Invoked when the app is about to become the foreground app. This is where last-minute preparations can be done.

- **`applicationWillResignActive(_:)`:** Notifies that the app is transitioning away from being the foreground app.

- **`applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)`:** Indicates that the app is now running in the background and may transition to a suspended state.

- **`applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)`:** Indicates that the app is transitioning from the background to the foreground but is not yet active.

- **`applicationWillTerminate(_:)`:** Notifies that the app is about to be terminated, providing a chance to perform any necessary cleanup.

These methods allow developers to effectively manage the app's behavior and resources at each stage of its lifecycle.

```swift
// Example Swift code
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, willFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        // First chance to execute code
        return true
    }

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        // Final initialization before the app is displayed
        return true
    }

    func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        // App is becoming the foreground app
    }

    func applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        // App is transitioning away from the foreground
    }

    func applicationDidEnterBackground(_ application: UIApplication) {
        // App is now in the background
    }

    func applicationWillEnterForeground(_ application: UIApplication) {
        // App is transitioning to the foreground
    }

    func applicationWillTerminate(_ application: UIApplication) {
        // App is about to be terminated
    }
}
```

#### Additional Details
Understanding the importance of these lifecycle methods is crucial for managing resources effectively, ensuring a smooth user experience, and handling tasks such as saving data or releasing resources when the app is not active.

:::tip[In Bullets]
- **Lifecycle Management:** Use `UIApplicationDelegate` methods to manage app behavior during different lifecycle stages.
- **Initialization:** Perform initial setup in `application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` and `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`.
- **State Transitions:** Respond to app state changes using `applicationDidBecomeActive(_:)`, `applicationWillResignActive(_:)`, `applicationDidEnterBackground(_:)`, and `applicationWillEnterForeground(_:)`.
- **Termination:** Clean up resources in `applicationWillTerminate(_:)`.
