As the name suggests,`CaseIterable` is a protocol that provides a handy way of iterating through all of the individual cases in anenum.

When using anenumthat conforms to CaseIterable,you can access a collection of all of the enumâ€™s cases by using the `allCases` property:

```swift
enum CompassDirection: CaseIterable {
    case north, south, east, west
}

// "There are 4 directions."
print("There are \(CompassDirection.allCases.count) directions.")

let caseList = CompassDirection.allCases.map({ "\($ 0 )" })
                    .joined(separator: ", ")
                    //"north, south, east, west"
print(caseList)
```

`allCases` provides the cases in the order of their declaration.

If your `enum` does not contain any associated values or availability attributes, Swift will automatically synthesize conformance to the `CaseIterable` protocol for you.
