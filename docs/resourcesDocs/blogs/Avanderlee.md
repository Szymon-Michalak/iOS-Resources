### ðŸ”µ Understanding Tasks in Swift: A Guide to Concurrency

Tasks in Swift are a key part of the concurrency framework introduced at WWDC 2021. They enable the creation of concurrent environments from non-concurrent methods, making it easier to call methods using async/await. By leveraging tasks, developers can streamline their code, reduce verbosity compared to dispatch queues, and handle asynchronous operations more effectively.

#### Key Points
- **Tasks** are an integral part of Swift's concurrency model, enabling asynchronous code execution with async/await.
- **Cancellation handling** within tasks ensures that unnecessary work is avoided, which is crucial for performance and resource management.
- **Prioritization** of tasks allows developers to manage the order of execution, similar to dispatch queues but with simpler syntax.

#### Summary of Contents

- **Introduction to Tasks in Swift:** Provides an overview of how tasks are used in Swift, their purpose in the concurrency framework, and how they compare to dispatch queues.
  
- **Creating and Running Tasks:** 
  - **Basic Task Creation:** Demonstrates how to create a task in Swift, including how to return values or throw errors within a task.
  - **Task Execution:** Explains that tasks in Swift begin execution immediately upon creation, without the need for an explicit start command.

- **Handling Asynchronous Methods:** 
  - **Async Method Execution:** Illustrates how to use tasks to execute async methods within non-concurrent functions, including common errors and how to avoid them.

- **Task Cancellation:** 
  - **Importance of Cancellation:** Discusses the need to check for task cancellation to prevent unnecessary work, with examples of how to implement these checks.
  - **Cancellation Techniques:** Provides code examples for handling task cancellation using `Task.checkCancellation()` and `Task.isCancelled`.

- **Setting Task Priority:** 
  - **Managing Execution Order:** Explains how to set the priority for tasks, similar to quality of service levels in dispatch queues, to manage the order of task execution.

- **Thread Usage in Task Execution:** 
  - **Default Threading Behavior:** Details how tasks are executed on automatically managed background threads and how to verify the execution thread during debugging.

### ðŸ”µ Tasks in Swift Explained

This article explores how **tasks** enable concurrency in Swift, allowing asynchronous operations using `async/await`. Tasks simplify multi-threading by abstracting verbosity associated with dispatch queues, enabling clean, concise, and efficient code.

#### Key Points
- **Tasks Overview:** Introduced in WWDC 2021, tasks create a concurrent environment from non-concurrent methods.
- **Execution Characteristics:**  
  - Tasks run immediately after creation.
  - Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations.  
  - Allow error handling and return values.
- **Cancellation:** Tasks run regardless of references unless explicitly cancelled, with cancellation checks preventing unnecessary work.
- **Priority Management:** Tasks have priorities (`low`, `medium`, `high`), influencing execution order.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Creating Tasks:** Demonstrates synchronous and asynchronous task creation.
- **Executing Tasks:** Explains default immediate execution and task result handling.
- **Cancellation:** Discusses cancellation techniques using `Task.cancel()`, `Task.checkCancellation()`, and `Task.isCancelled`.
- **Priority Management:** Explains task priority levels and their impact on scheduling.
- **Practical Examples:** Covers fetching images asynchronously and handling cancellation.
