## **Best Practices**

### ðŸ”µ Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using Enums in Swift

This article explores **common mistakes developers make when using enums in Swift**, such as **poor cohesion** when mapping values, **lazy switch statements**, and **assumptions** about **automatic raw value incrementation**. It also provides **best practices** to improve **code reliability** and **maintainability** in **iOS development**.

#### Key Points
- **Lack of Cohesion:** Avoid **mapping network statuses** directly to **view statuses** without clear logic, which can lead to **maintainability issues**.
- **Lazy Switch Cases:** Be cautious when using the **default clause** in **switch statements**; it can hide **unhandled cases** and lead to **unexpected behavior**.
- **Assuming Raw Value Incrementation:** Never rely on **Swift's automatic raw value assignment** for **enums**, as it can lead to **fragile code**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Lack of Cohesion When Mapping Values:** Discusses the problem of **mapping network statuses** to **view statuses** without considering future changes and how to **refactor** the code to maintain **cohesion**.
- **Lazy Switch or Using Default Clause:** Explains the pitfalls of using **default clauses** in **switch statements** and recommends explicitly handling each **enum case**.
- **Assuming Automatic Raw Value Incrementation:** Warns against relying on **Swift's automatic raw value incrementation** for **enums**, advising developers to use **explicit values** to avoid **bugs**.
