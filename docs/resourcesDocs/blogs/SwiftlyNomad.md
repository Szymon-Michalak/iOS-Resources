### ðŸ”µ The Bridge Pattern in Swift

The Bridge Pattern is a **structural design pattern** that separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation, enabling both to evolve independently. It is especially valuable in Swift for managing complex systems with multiple variations and avoiding tightly coupled hierarchies.

**Tags:**  
`design-patterns`, `swift`, `ios-development`, `bridge-pattern`, `architecture`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **Definition:** Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing independent evolution of both.
- **Use Cases:** Avoids subclass explosion, supports extensibility, and simplifies complex systems.
- **Applicability:** Ideal when abstraction and implementation need independent variation.
- **Relationships:** Complements patterns like Adapter, Decorator, and Composite.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Explanation of the Bridge Pattern and its significance in Swift.
- **Conceptual Example:** Shapes and rendering mechanisms demonstrating abstraction-implementation decoupling.
- **Real-World Applications:** Graphical libraries managing shapes and rendering methods independently.
- **Pseudocode:** Protocol-based Swift example with `Shape` and `Color` hierarchies.
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Identify aspects for independent variation.
  - Define protocols for abstraction and implementation.
  - Create concrete classes for abstraction and implementation.
  - Establish the bridge through a reference in the abstraction.
- **Pros and Cons:** Highlights advantages like extensibility and disadvantages like added complexity.
- **Pattern Relationships:** Comparisons and synergies with Adapter, Decorator, and Composite patterns.

### ðŸ”µ The Proxy Pattern in Swift

The Proxy Pattern is a **structural design pattern** that acts as a placeholder or surrogate for another object, enabling control over access to the original object. It supports functionality like lazy loading, access control, and logging without altering the core objectâ€™s code.

**Published:** [2023-10-31]

**Authors:** `Swiftly Nomad`

**Tags:**  
`design-patterns`, `swift`, `ios-development`, `proxy-pattern`, `lazy-loading`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **Definition:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to another object.
- **Use Cases:** Commonly used for lazy loading, access control, and adding logging or monitoring.
- **Advantages:** Improves performance, enables controlled access, and supports instrumentation.
- **Disadvantages:** Adds complexity, potential indirection overhead, and risks of overuse.
- **Relationships:** Similar to the Decorator Pattern but focuses on access control. Can be used with Adapter and Singleton patterns.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Explanation of the Proxy Pattern and its purpose in Swift development.
- **Conceptual Example:** Proxy for image loading to delay expensive operations until required.
- **Real-World Applications:** Cloud storage proxies representing remote files to save bandwidth and storage.
- **Implementation Steps:** A step-by-step guide to creating proxies for managing access and functionality.
- **Code Examples:** Example implementation of an `ImageProxy` that provides lazy initialization for image loading.
- **Pros and Cons:** Highlights the benefits and trade-offs of using the Proxy Pattern.
- **Pattern Relationships:** Discusses similarities and synergies with other design patterns like Decorator and Adapter.
