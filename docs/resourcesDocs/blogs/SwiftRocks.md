#### Key Points
- **Distinction Between Theory and Practical Skills:** The blog emphasizes that while one can be a functional programmer without deep **theoretical knowledge**, understanding **CS fundamentals** greatly enhances **problem-solving capabilities**.
- **Misplaced Resentment:** Developers often conflate their disdain for **outdated interview practices** with a dislike for the **theory** itself, which the author argues is a mistake.
- **Music Theory Analogy:** The post uses the analogy of **music theory** to explain how **theoretical knowledge** underpins **practical skills** and can lead to **mastery**.
- **Career Impact:** For developers aspiring to work at **top tech companies** or who want to **diversify** their platform expertise, a solid grounding in **computer science** is crucial.
- **Improving Interview Processes:** The author suggests that companies move away from **trivia** and difficult **LeetCode-style questions** towards more relevant, **product-focused** questions that assess real-world **problem-solving abilities**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Overview of the author's personal motivation to write about the importance of **computer science fundamentals**.
- **Developers' Hatred for Theory:** Discusses the common aversion to **theoretical knowledge** due to its association with difficult **interview processes**.
- **The Hatred is Misplaced:** Argues that the dislike for **interview practices** should not translate into a dismissal of the **theory** itself.
- **Analogy: Becoming a Professional Musician:** Compares learning **programming fundamentals** to learning **music theory** and how it enhances overall **skill**.
- **The Same is True for Programming:** Expands on the analogy, explaining the importance of understanding **theory** for better **coding practices**.
- **Who Really Needs to Learn the Theory?:** Discusses the relevance of **theory** depending on a developer's **career goals**.
- **Why are Top-Tier Companies Obsessed with the Fundamentals?:** Explores why companies like **Google** emphasize **theoretical knowledge** in their **hiring practices**.
- **Creating Better Interview Processes:** Proposes ideas for improving how companies assess candidates' **knowledge** and **skills** during **interviews**.
