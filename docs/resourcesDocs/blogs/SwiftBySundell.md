### ðŸ”µ Launch Arguments in Swift
This article by **John Sundell** explores how to effectively use **launch arguments** in **Swift**, particularly for **iOS development**. **Launch arguments** are typically used with **command-line tools**, but this article demonstrates their usefulness in **debugging**, **testing**, and **feature flagging** within **iOS apps**. By integrating **launch arguments**, developers can **streamline** their workflow, quickly setting up specific **app states**, simulating **network conditions**, and more.

**Published:** 20 May 2018

**Authors:** `John Sundell`

**Tags:**  
`scripting`, `debugging`, `ui-testing`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **Swiftâ€™s `CommandLine` API** can be used to access **launch arguments**, making it easy to switch between different **app states**.
- **`UserDefaults`** can parse **launch arguments** into useful data types like **`Bool`**, **`Int`**, and **`Double`**, providing more flexibility.
- Practical applications include **debugging** **network issues**, **overriding** **feature flags**, and setting specific **app states** for **UI testing**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Parsing Launch Arguments:** How to use **`CommandLine`** and **`UserDefaults`** for handling **launch arguments**.
- **Passing Launch Arguments:** Methods to pass arguments using **Xcode** for **testing** and **debugging**.
- **Debug Actions:** Using **launch arguments** to simulate conditions like **slow network performance**.
- **Overriding Feature Flags:** Simplifying **feature development** by **overriding server-based feature flags** locally.
- **Setting State:** Automating repetitive tasks like **resetting the app state** or **pre-populating data** for **testing**.

#### Additional Resources
- **Feature flags in Swift:** Learn more about using **feature flags** in **iOS development**.
- **Getting started with Xcode UI testing in Swift:** A guide to using **Xcode's UI testing** features.

## **Debuging**

### ðŸ”µ Feature Flags in Swift

This blog post by **John Sundell** provides an in-depth look at using **feature flags** in **Swift development**. **Feature flags** are essential tools for **gradually rolling out new features**, performing **A/B testing**, and managing different **code paths** at **compile time** or **runtime**. The article discusses various strategies, including **conditional compilation**, **static flags**, and **runtime flags**, with practical **code examples** for each.

<details>

**URL:** [Feature flags in Swift](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/feature-flags-in-swift/)

**Published:** 25 Mar 2018

**Authors:** `John Sundell`

**Tags:**  
`Swift`, `feature flags`, `architecture`, `maintenance`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **Feature flags** help in **rolling out new implementations gradually**, **reducing the risk** of big changes, and enabling **A/B testing**.
- **Conditional compilation** allows developers to remove certain **code blocks** from **production builds** using **compiler flags**.
- **Static feature flags** provide a simple way to control **feature availability** at **runtime** but cannot be modified after **compilation**.
- **Runtime feature flags** offer greater **flexibility** by allowing **dynamic control** of features, though they add **complexity** to the app's **maintenance** and **debugging**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Conditional Compilation:** Explanation of how to use **compiler flags** to gate **code blocks** during the **build process**.
- **Static Flags:** Discussion on using **static properties** in a **FeatureFlags** struct to manage **feature availability**.
- **Runtime Flags:** Overview of dynamically controlling **feature flags** using **backend systems**, with an example of **loading flags** from a **JSON response**.

## **API Design**

### ðŸŸ¢ Using @autoclosure When Designing Swift APIs

The article discusses how Swift's **`@autoclosure`** attribute can simplify API design by **deferring the execution** of expressions until needed. It highlights the advantages of using **`@autoclosure`** in **reducing verbosity**, **improving readability**, and **enhancing performance**. Examples include its use in **assertions**, **animations**, **error handling**, and **default value assignments** in dictionaries.

**Published:** 28 May 2017

**Authors:** `John Sundell`

**Tags:**  
`language features`, `api design`, `Swift 5.0`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **`@autoclosure`** wraps an argument in a closure, **deferring its execution** until it's actually needed.
- Simplifies function calls by **removing the need for explicit closures** at the call site.
- Used in the **Swift standard library**, such as in **`assert`**, to avoid **unnecessary evaluations** in production builds.
- Enhances **API design** by **reducing verbosity** without sacrificing **code readability** or **performance**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Overview of **`@autoclosure`** and its primary use cases.
- **Inlining Assignments:** How **`@autoclosure`** can reduce syntax cruft in **animation functions**.
- **Passing Errors as Expressions:** Using **`@autoclosure`** in **error handling** within custom APIs.
- **Type Inference with Default Values:** Improving **type inference** when extracting values from **untyped dictionaries**.
- **Conclusion:** The balance between **reducing verbosity** and maintaining **code expressiveness**.
