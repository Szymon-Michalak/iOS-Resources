## **SwiftUI**

### ðŸ”µ How to Fix Slow List Updates in SwiftUI

This article addresses a common issue in **SwiftUI** where sorting or filtering large datasets in a `List` view can lead to significant **performance delays**. The article explains why these delays occur and presents a simple, one-line solution to mitigate the problem using the **`.id(UUID())` modifier**. Additionally, it delves into the **mechanics of SwiftUI** that cause the issue and discusses the **trade-offs** involved with the fix, such as losing **animations** during list updates.

#### Key Points
- The problem occurs when a **large list** in **SwiftUI** takes significant time to update after **sorting** or **filtering**.
- The root cause is **SwiftUI's process** of comparing old and new list items to animate changes, which is **computationally expensive** for large datasets.
- The **`.id(UUID())` modifier** effectively resolves this issue by forcing **SwiftUI** to treat the list as a **new one**, thus bypassing the expensive comparison process.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Problem Explanation:** The article begins by demonstrating the problem with a **code example** that causes performance delays in a **SwiftUI `List`** when shuffled.
- **The Fix:** Introduces a **one-line solution** using **`.id(UUID())`** that dramatically **improves performance**.
- **Deep Dive:** The article explains why the fix works, including a discussion of **SwiftUIâ€™s list comparison process**.
- **Trade-offs:** It concludes with a discussion on the **trade-offs**, such as the **loss of animations** when using this fix.
