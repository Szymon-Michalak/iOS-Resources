## **SwiftUI**

### ðŸ”µ How to Fix Slow List Updates in SwiftUI

This article addresses a common issue in **SwiftUI** where sorting or filtering large datasets in a `List` view can lead to significant **performance delays**. The article explains why these delays occur and presents a simple, one-line solution to mitigate the problem using the **`.id(UUID())` modifier**. Additionally, it delves into the **mechanics of SwiftUI** that cause the issue and discusses the **trade-offs** involved with the fix, such as losing **animations** during list updates.

**URL:** https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/210/how-to-fix-slow-list-updates-in-swiftui

**Published:** November 3rd, 2023

**Authors:** `Paul Hudson`

**Tags:**  
`SwiftUI`, `Performance`, `Optimization`

</details>

#### Key Points
- The problem occurs when a **large list** in **SwiftUI** takes significant time to update after **sorting** or **filtering**.
- The root cause is **SwiftUI's process** of comparing old and new list items to animate changes, which is **computationally expensive** for large datasets.
- The **`.id(UUID())` modifier** effectively resolves this issue by forcing **SwiftUI** to treat the list as a **new one**, thus bypassing the expensive comparison process.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Problem Explanation:** The article begins by demonstrating the problem with a **code example** that causes performance delays in a **SwiftUI `List`** when shuffled.
- **The Fix:** Introduces a **one-line solution** using **`.id(UUID())`** that dramatically **improves performance**.
- **Deep Dive:** The article explains why the fix works, including a discussion of **SwiftUIâ€™s list comparison process**.
- **Trade-offs:** It concludes with a discussion on the **trade-offs**, such as the **loss of animations** when using this fix.

### ðŸ”µ Running Tasks Using SwiftUI's `task()` Modifier

**SwiftUI**'s `task()` modifier, introduced with the concurrency framework, allows developers to run **async tasks** when a view appears, while also automatically canceling those tasks when the view disappears. This makes handling asynchronous operations more efficient compared to traditional methods.

<details>

**URL:** [Tasks in Swift explained with code examples](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/concurrency/tasks/)  
**Published:** 2021-09-23  
**Authors:** `Paul Hudson`  
**Tags:**  
`Swift`, `SwiftUI`, `async-await`, `concurrency`, `iOS`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **`task()` Modifier**: Simplifies async task management in SwiftUI views by creating and canceling tasks as views appear and disappear.
- **Task Cancellation**: Automatically cancels tasks when views disappear, saving resources and optimizing performance.
- **Tracking Identifiers**: `task()` can track `Equatable` values to cancel and restart tasks when identifiers change.

#### Summary of Contents

- **Basic Task Example**:
  - Using `task()` to download data from a server and populate a SwiftUI list. Shows the simplicity of running async operations in SwiftUI.
  
- **Advanced Usage**:
  - Introduces a way to handle tasks that update based on changing identifiers, such as switching between an Inbox and Sent message list.

- **Task Priority and AsyncSequence**:
  - Explains the use of priorities in tasks, and how `AsyncSequence` can be leveraged to handle continuous data streams like a random number generator.

#### Additional Resources
- **[Async await in Swift explained with code examples](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift/async-await/):** A guide to understanding async/await in Swift.
- **[Whatâ€™s the difference between async let, tasks, and task groups?](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/concurrency/async-let-tasks-task-groups):** Detailed comparison of concurrency options in Swift.

**Authors:** `Paul Hudson`  

**Tags:**  
`swiftui`, `concurrency`, `tasks`, `async-sequence`, `ios-development`

</details>

#### Key Points
- **Core Functionality:**  
  - Automatically starts tasks when views appear and cancels them when views disappear.
  - Supports task identifiers to restart tasks upon changes in state.
- **Advanced Use Cases:**  
  - Fetching data for dynamic UI elements using `task(id:)`.
  - Streaming real-time data with `AsyncSequence` and task cancellation.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Basic Usage:** The `task()` modifier fetches and decodes JSON for a messaging app, showcasing initial data loading.
- **Advanced Task Management:** Explains handling dynamic state changes with `task(id:)` to adapt tasks to user interactions.
- **Streaming Data:** Demonstrates real-time number generation using `AsyncSequence` and task cancellation in a detail view.
