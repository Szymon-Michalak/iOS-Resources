#### Key Points
- The discussion explores the compatibility issues between Codable and @MainActor properties in Swift 6.
- Codable, designed for Swift's serialization, conflicts with @MainActor's concurrency isolation requirements.
- Suggestions include using separate Codable structs or reconsidering class design to avoid isolation conflicts.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Discussion on the challenges posed by Swift 6's concurrency model for Codable classes.
- **Main Sections:** Analysis of the impact of @MainActor on Codable conformance, with user experiences and proposed solutions.
- **Technical Details:** Examination of how actor isolation affects protocol conformances like Codable.
- **Applications and Examples:** Real-world scenarios where @MainActor properties impact serialization and data management.
- **Conclusion:** Reflections on potential enhancements to Swift's concurrency model to better support Codable classes.
