## **Concurrency**

### ðŸ”µ **Running Tasks in Parallel in Swift**

This blog post explores various methods for **running tasks in parallel** using **Swift**. It covers both traditional tools, such as **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)** and **operation queues**, and newer techniques introduced with Swift's **structured concurrency API**. The post includes **detailed code examples** and highlights the benefits of each approach, particularly focusing on the ability to **limit the number of concurrent operations** for better **performance** and **resource management**.
