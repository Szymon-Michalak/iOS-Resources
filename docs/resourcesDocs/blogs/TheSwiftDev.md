#### Key Points
- Discusses the benefits of running tasks in parallel to utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently.
- Introduces Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) for managing concurrent operations with serial and concurrent dispatch queues.
- Demonstrates using Operation Queues to control concurrent tasks and manage dependencies.
- Introduces structured concurrency in Swift, highlighting the `withTaskGroup` function for managing concurrent tasks in a structured manner.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Overview of the importance of parallelism in Swift programming.
- **Grand Central Dispatch:** Explanation of GCD and its use in managing concurrent tasks.
- **Operation Queues:** Example of using Operation Queues to handle concurrent tasks with limited concurrency.
- **Structured Concurrency:** Introduction to structured concurrency using the `withTaskGroup` function for safer and more predictable concurrent programming.
- **Conclusion:** Highlights the advantages of structured concurrency over traditional methods.
