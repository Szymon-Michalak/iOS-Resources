## **UIKit**

### ðŸ”µ UIKit Styling with Functions

This blog post explores various approaches to **styling UI components** in **UIKit**, focusing on the **composability** and **reusability** of styles. It introduces different methods, including **UIAppearance**, **subclassing**, **object composition**, and **function composition**, each with practical examples. These techniques aim to solve common **styling problems** in **iOS development** by enhancing **flexibility** and reducing **redundancy**.

#### Key Points
- **UIAppearance:** A protocol that allows **reusable styling** by configuring **view properties** at the **class level**.
- **Subclassing:** A common approach to manage **reusable styles** by creating **base classes** and inheriting them.
- **Object Composition:** Preferring **composition over inheritance** by defining **reusable styles** through **static properties**.
- **Function Composition:** Using **functions** to create **reusable** and **composable styles**, solving the **diamond inheritance problem**.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Overview of the abstract concepts covered in previous episodes and their application to **UIKit**.
- **UIAppearance:** Explanation of how **UIAppearance** works and its limitations.
- **Subclassing:** Discussion of **subclassing** as a solution for **reusable styling**, including examples of **base** and **specialized buttons**.
- **Object Composition:** Demonstrates the use of **static properties** to achieve **composition over inheritance**.
- **Functions:** Introduction to using **functions** for styling, leading to more **flexible** and **reusable code**.
- **Function Composition:** Details on composing **functions** to create complex, **reusable styles** without relying on **inheritance**.

#### Additional Resources
- **[Episode on Side Effects](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep2-side-effects):** Explores the concept of **side effects** in **Swift** and introduces **function composition**.
- **[Algebraic Data Types](https://www.pointfree.co/episodes/ep4-algebraic-data-types):** The next episode that discusses **algebraic data types** and their use in **Swift**.
