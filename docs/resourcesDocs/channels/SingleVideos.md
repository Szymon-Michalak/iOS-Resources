#### Key Points
- **Basic Animations:** Learn how to animate properties like stroke length using the `trim` modifier and `@State`.
- **Phase Animations:** Animate through multiple discrete states, like scaling or rotation, with `PhaseAnimator`.
- **Keyframe Animations:** Handle complex, timed animations by interpolating between values over time.
- **Particle Animations:** Create advanced effects with `TimelineView` and `Canvas`.

#### Summary of Contents
1. **Basic Animations:**
   - Wrap shapes in a `ZStack` and animate properties like `trim` for stroke effects.
   - Use `@State` for toggling between states and `withAnimation` for seamless transitions.
2. **Phase Animations:**
   - Create multiple phases (e.g., scaling, rotating) using `PhaseAnimator`.
   - Trigger animations based on state changes.
3. **Keyframe Animations:**
   - Animate individual properties over custom timelines.
   - Use structs to define keyframe values and interpolate over time.
4. **Particle Animations:**
   - Build dynamic effects using `TimelineView` for per-frame updates.
   - Use `Canvas` for direct rendering of custom particles.
5. **Render Tree Analysis:**
   - Explore how animations are applied to SwiftUI's render tree.
   - Use debugging tools like `speed` to slow down animations for inspection.
