#### Key Points
- Provides a streamlined method to identify differences between two instances of any type, beneficial for Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Improves upon standard equality assertions in testing frameworks like XCTest by highlighting exactly what properties or values differ.
- Supports integration with XCTest, Quick, and The Composable Architecture for enhanced testing capabilities.

#### Summary of Contents
- **Introduction:** Introduces the need for a clearer way to identify differences in test results.
- **Installation:** Instructions for integrating the Difference library via CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager.
- **Using lldb:** Explains how to use `po dumpDiff(expected, received)` to view differences in instances during debugging.
- **Integrate with XCTest:** Provides code snippets for integrating with XCTest to enhance assertion messages.
- **Integrate with Quick:** Guides on integrating with the Quick testing framework to improve error messages for assertions.
- **Integrate with The Composable Architecture:** Demonstrates integration with a specific architecture for more detailed state comparison.
- **Conclusion:** Emphasizes the benefits of using Difference to streamline debugging and improve testing efficiency.
