### R.swift
R.swift is a tool that provides safe, type-safe access to your appâ€™s resources, such as images, fonts, colors, storyboards, and more. By generating strongly typed code, R.swift helps eliminate runtime errors due to incorrect resource names and makes resource management easier and more reliable.

#### Key Features
- **Type Safety:** Generates strongly typed, auto-completed code for all resources, including images, fonts, colors, and storyboards.
- **Compile-Time Validation:** Detects missing resources at compile time, reducing the risk of runtime crashes.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple to integrate with minimal setup and seamless Xcode integration.
- **Supports All Resource Types:** Works with images, storyboards, nibs, fonts, colors, and localized strings.
- **Automated Updates:** Automatically updates the generated code with every build, ensuring your resources are always in sync.

#### Integration
- **Installation:**
  - **CocoaPods:** Add `pod 'R.swift'` to your Podfile.
  - **Carthage:** Add `github "mac-cain13/R.swift"` to your Cartfile.
  - **Manual:** Download the R.swift executable and add a Run Script Phase in Xcode to generate the R.swift file.
- **Configuration:** After installation, configure the build phase in Xcode to run R.swift and generate the type-safe resource access code.

- **Basic Usage:**

```swift
import Rswift

// Accessing an image resource
let image = R.image.logo()

// Accessing a localized string
let welcomeText = R.string.localizable.welcome()

// Instantiating a view controller from a storyboard
let viewController = R.storyboard.main.myViewController()
```

#### Use Cases
- **Resource Management:** Safely access app resources, such as images and fonts, without worrying about typos or missing files.
- **Localization:** Manage and access localized strings with type-safe access to ensure correctness.
- **Storyboard Management:** Safely instantiate view controllers from storyboards with type-safe identifiers.

#### Notes
- **Compile-Time Safety:** R.swift helps catch errors early by validating resource references at compile time.
- **Automation:** Automatically updates the generated R.swift file during each build, keeping your resources in sync with your code.
