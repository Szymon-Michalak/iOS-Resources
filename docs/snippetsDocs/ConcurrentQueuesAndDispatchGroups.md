## Overview
Concurrency in Swift, using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD), allows developers to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, utilizing device cores efficiently. By combining **concurrent queues** and **dispatch groups**, we can execute independent tasks in parallel and synchronize them once all tasks are completed.

### Why Use Concurrent Queues?
Concurrent queues allow multiple blocks of code to run simultaneously, making the most of the available resources. This is particularly useful in scenarios like image processing or network requests where tasks can be performed independently.

### Dispatch Groups for Synchronization
A **dispatch group** helps in managing multiple tasks by notifying when all the tasks in the group have been completed. This is crucial for tasks that need to be synchronized after multiple parallel operations are performed.

### Example Implementation
In a photo book app, you might want to resize and crop photos concurrently before compiling them into a PDF. Hereâ€™s how to implement this using a concurrent queue and a dispatch group:

```swift
let processingQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "PhotoProcessingQueue", attributes: .concurrent)
let group = DispatchGroup()
let processedPhotos = NSMutableArray(array: photos)

for (index, photo) in photos.enumerated() {
    group.enter()
    processingQueue.async {
        let resizedPhoto = resize(photo)
        let croppedPhoto = crop(resizedPhoto)
        processedPhotos[index] = croppedPhoto
        group.leave()
    }
}

group.notify(queue: .main) {
    let photoBookURL = createPhotoBook(from: processedPhotos as! [UIImage])
    completion(photoBookURL)
}
```

### How It Works
1. **Concurrent Queue**: Tasks such as resizing and cropping photos are split into smaller blocks and executed concurrently on the processing queue.
2. **Dispatch Group**: Each task enters the group before starting and leaves the group once completed. The `notify` method triggers the photo book creation after all tasks are finished.

### Benefits
- **Improved Performance**: By running tasks concurrently, you make better use of CPU cores, which can reduce overall processing time.
- **UI Responsiveness**: By offloading tasks to a background queue, the main queue remains free to handle UI updates, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Best Practices
- Ensure that tasks within a dispatch group are truly independent to avoid race conditions.
- Use the main queue for any UI updates to maintain thread safety.
