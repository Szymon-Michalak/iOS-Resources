# üìÅüìè Folder Naming and File Structure

This DeepDive presents best practices for naming **folders** in iOS projects. Following these conventions helps maintain consistency, readability, and scalability, making projects easier to navigate and collaborate on.

#### General Folder Naming Guidelines

1. **Use Descriptive and Contextual Folder Names**  
Folder names should **describe their contents clearly** and provide context to avoid confusion. This is especially important for distinguishing between different layers like **Views**, **Models**, and **Services** within feature modules. Contextual naming also helps when folders are viewed outside the project, such as in code reviews or remote repositories.  

2. **Use PascalCase for Core Feature or Domain Folders, Lowercase for Resource Folders.**  
This distinction helps differentiate between **business logic** and **static resources**, making the folder structure more intuitive.
   - **PascalCase** is suitable for **feature-related** or **domain-specific folders** (e.g., `UserProfile`, `LoginService`, `ProductDetails`).
   - Use **lowercase** for **resource-related folders**, which often include assets, fonts, and other static resources (e.g., `assets`, `fonts`, `localization`).

3. **Singular vs. Plural Folder Names**
   - **Plural folder names** should be used when the folder contains **collections** or **multiple instances** of something (e.g., `Assets`, `Images`, `Resources`).
   - Use **singular names** for folders that represent a **single type** of item, such as `View`, `Model`, or `Service`.

4. **Consistent Naming Across Features and Modules**  
Folder names should be **consistent** across features, following a standard structure. For instance, if a feature folder contains `View`, `Model`, and `Service` subfolders, all feature folders should follow this pattern.

5. **Avoid Unnecessary Redundancy, But Use Context When Needed**  
While folder names shouldn‚Äôt repeat unnecessary information, **some redundancy** can provide clarity, especially in nested folders. For example, within a `UserProfile` feature folder, subfolders like `UserProfileViewModel.swift` may provide necessary context.

6. **Flexibility in Folder Structure for Large Apps**  
In larger iOS projects, the folder structure might evolve to accommodate complex feature modules, shared services, and cross-domain logic. Maintain a **balance** between standardization and flexibility to avoid over-complicating the project.
   - **Core vs. Shared**: Use clear boundaries between critical app logic (stored in **Core**) and reusable components (stored in **Shared**).
   - **Features vs. Domain**: Distinguish between feature-specific folders (e.g., `Login`, `UserProfile`) and domain-based folders for shared logic (e.g., `User`, `Order`).

## **/GroupByFeature/**

#### **When to Group by Feature (Recommended for Most Projects)**

Organizing files by **feature** or **module** is an effective way to maintain scalability and modularity. In projects where features are independent (e.g., login, user profile, checkout), this approach encapsulates all feature-related components, such as views, models, view models, and services, within a specific folder.

#### **Folder Naming Conventions in Feature-Based Organization**

| **Name**  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View**         | Contains UI components specific to the feature. Use singular `View` for a standard set of views. For large features with many views, you may subdivide views into more descriptive folders (e.g., `FormView`, `DetailView`). |
| **ViewModel**    | Manages the presentation logic for the feature, typically following the MVVM architecture. If multiple view models are necessary, give them specific names based on their functionality (e.g., `LoginFormViewModel.swift`). |
| **Service**      | Handles networking, data fetching, or other external communication related to the feature.                                                        |
| **Model**        | Represents data structures used within the feature. For features with multiple models, group them into subfolders (e.g., `RequestModels`, `ResponseModels`). |
| **Constants**    | Stores constants that are specific to the feature, such as API endpoints, keys, or static strings. If constants are used across features, consider moving them to **Core**. |
| **Coordinator**  | (Optional) If following the coordinator pattern, this folder contains navigation logic specific to the feature.                                    |
| **Repository**   | (Optional) When using a repository pattern, handles the data layer logic, abstracting the data source.                                             |

Example Folder Structure for a Feature** (with Multiple Views and Models)

```
/Features/
    /Login/
        /View/
            LoginFormView.swift
            LoginSuccessView.swift
        /ViewModel/
            LoginFormViewModel.swift
        /Service/
            LoginAPIService.swift
        /Model/
            /RequestModels/
                LoginRequestModel.swift
            /ResponseModels/
                LoginResponseModel.swift
        /Constants/
            LoginConstants.swift
```

#### **When to Place Models or Constants Inside Feature Folders vs. Core/Shared Folders**

Deciding whether to store models, constants, or other resources in a feature folder or the **Core/Shared** folder depends on **reusability** and **scope**:

When to Keep Models and Constants Inside the Feature Folder:
- **Feature-Specific**: If the model or constant is **specific to the feature** and **unlikely to be reused** by other features (e.g., `LoginRequestModel`, `LoginResponseModel`), keep it inside the feature folder.
- **Temporary Logic**: If the logic or data model is related to a short-lived feature or specific implementation detail, it should stay in the feature folder to prevent cluttering the shared logic.

When to Move Models or Constants to Core/Shared:
- **Reusable Across Features**: If the model or constant is **used across multiple features**, it should be placed in the **Core/Shared** folder. For instance, a `UserModel` that is referenced in both `Login` and `UserProfile` should go into the shared folder to avoid duplication.
- **Global Constants**: Constants that are relevant across the entire app (e.g., **API base URLs**, **common strings**) should be placed in a shared constants file in **Core/Shared** rather than inside a specific feature folder.

#### **Key Characteristics of Feature-Based Grouping**:

1. **Encapsulation**: Components related to the same feature are grouped together, making the code easier to manage and navigate.
2. **Scalability**: New features are easily added without affecting the structure of the existing codebase.
3. **Clarity and Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained, making the app easier to test and modify without introducing unexpected bugs.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Each folder handles a specific aspect of the feature, ensuring clean separation of logic.

#### **When to Avoid Feature-Based Grouping**:
- **Small Projects**: If the app is small and has limited functionality, a feature-based grouping approach might introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Highly Interdependent Features**: If features are highly coupled and share a lot of business logic, a **domain-based grouping** may be more appropriate. We'll cover this in the **Group by Domain** section next.

---

## **/GroupByDomain/**

#### **When to Group by Domain (Recommended for Larger Projects)**

As apps grow in complexity, a **Group by Domain** approach is often better suited for maintaining scalability. Domains represent **business areas** or **logical units** (e.g., `UserManagement`, `ProductCatalog`, `OrderProcessing`) that contain multiple related features. Grouping by domain promotes **clear separation of concerns** and **modular design** by encapsulating everything related to a particular business domain.

#### **Organizing Files Inside a Domain Folder**

Within each domain folder, you can organize files similarly to the **Group by Feature** approach. The key difference is that these folders contain **cross-feature logic** that might be used by several features related to that domain.

Common Folder Names in Domain-Based Grouping:

| **Name**  | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**        | Stores **domain models** that represent core entities in your app (e.g., `User`, `Order`, `Product`). These models are shared across features.     |
| **Repository**   | Contains repositories t hat abstract the data access layer, handling logic for fetching and storing data related to the domain.                     |
| **Service**      | Houses **business logic services** that are used across the domain. For example, an `OrderService` might be responsible for order validation and processing. |
| **ViewModel**    | (Optional) If the domain includes cross-feature view models, they can be stored here to manage shared presentation logic.                          |
| **Coordinator**  | (Optional) Contains coordinators that manage **navigation logic** for the domain.                                                                 |

#### **Example Folder Structure for Domain-Based Organization**:

```
/Domain/
    /UserManagement/
        /Model/
            User.swift
        /Service/
            UserService.swift
        /Repository/
            UserRepository.swift
    /ProductCatalog/
        /Model/
            Product.swift
        /Service/
            ProductService.swift
        /Repository/
            ProductRepository.swift
    /OrderProcessing/
        /Model/
            Order.swift
        /Service/
            OrderService.swift
        /Repository/
            OrderRepository.swift
```

#### **When to Use Domain-Based Grouping**

Use Domain-Based Grouping When:
1. **Your App is Large or Complex**: For apps with multiple **cross-feature domains**, such as an e-commerce app with domains like `UserManagement`, `ProductCatalog`, and `OrderProcessing`.
2. **Overlapping Logic Across Features**: If multiple features share data models, services, or repositories, grouping by domain ensures that common logic is centralized.
3. **Business-Oriented Development**: This approach works well for apps that reflect real-world business units (e.g., customers, products, orders), where each domain represents a major area of responsibility.
   

In an e-commerce app, you could have domains like `ProductCatalog`, `OrderProcessing`, and `UserManagement`. Each domain contains the logic that might be shared across multiple features (e.g., managing users, processing orders, or handling product inventory).

```
/Domain/
    /ProductCatalog/
        /Model/
            Product.swift
        /Service/
            ProductService.swift
        /Repository/
            ProductRepository.swift
    /OrderProcessing/
        /Model/
            Order.swift
        /Service/
            OrderService.swift
    /UserManagement/
        /Model/
            User.swift
        /Repository/
            UserRepository.swift
```

#### **Combining Domain-Based and Feature-Based Grouping**

In real-world projects, it‚Äôs common to combine **Group by Domain** and **Group by Feature**. This hybrid approach allows you to **group simple features** into isolated folders while centralizing **shared logic** in domain-based folders.

When to Combine Domain and Feature-Based Grouping:
- **Feature-Specific Components**: Simple, isolated features like login can be grouped by feature, while larger areas of the app (e.g., product catalog or user management) can be organized by domain.
- **Shared Models and Services**: Shared models and services should be placed in the domain folder to avoid duplication. Individual features can access these shared components as needed.

Example Structure Combining Features and Domains:

```
/Features/
    /Login/
        /View/
            LoginView.swift
        /ViewModel/
            LoginViewModel.swift
        /Service/
            LoginAPIService.swift
        /Model/
            LoginRequestModel.swift
/Domain/
    /UserManagement/
        /Model/
            User.swift
        /Service/
            UserService.swift
        /Repository/
            UserRepository.swift
```

#### **Benefits of Domain-Based Grouping**

1. **Business-Oriented Structure**: Reflects real-world business units or domains, making the codebase intuitive for developers familiar with the business logic.
2. **Encapsulation of Shared Logic**: Centralizes logic, models, and services that are shared across multiple features, avoiding duplication.
3. **Modularity and Scalability**: Promotes modularity, as each domain can grow independently, allowing teams to work on different domains without affecting others.

#### **When to Avoid Domain-Based Grouping**
- **Small Projects**: For smaller apps with limited complexity, domain-based grouping can introduce unnecessary overhead and complexity.
- **Feature-Specific Logic**: If a feature is very specific to one part of the app and doesn‚Äôt share much with other parts, it may be better to use a **feature-based approach** to avoid overcomplicating the structure.

## **/Core/**

The Core folder contains the essential, business-critical components of your app. This folder centralizes functionality related to data handling, services, domain logic, and app-wide configurations. The Core folder is designed to encapsulate the app‚Äôs core functionality, ensuring that the app can scale, be maintained easily, and remain organized.

### **/Data/**

The Data folder manages all aspects of **data handling** within the app. This includes external API communication, local data persistence (via CoreData or other databases), and services for interacting with remote or local data sources. The goal is to centralize data-related logic so that the business logic can be cleanly separated from data retrieval or storage.

#### **Breakdown**:
```
/Data/
    /API/
        APIClient.swift
        APIRequest.swift
        APIConfiguration.swift
        APIParser.swift
    /Services/
        AuthService.swift
        SessionManager.swift
        LocationService.swift
    /Repositories/
        UserRepository.swift
        ProductRepository.swift
    /Model/
        User.swift
        Product.swift
        Order.swift
    /LocalData/
        /CoreData/
            CoreDataManager.swift
            CoreDataMigrations.swift
        /Caching/
            DiskCache.swift
            MemoryCache.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **/API/**:
   - **Purpose**: Centralizes all logic related to **API communication**, including sending requests, parsing responses, and managing API-specific configurations (e.g., authentication tokens, base URLs).
   - **What goes here**:
     - **APIClient.swift**: Manages network requests and handles retry logic, error handling, and response parsing.
     - **APIRequest.swift**: Defines the structure of API requests, specifying endpoints, parameters, and headers.
     - **APIConfiguration.swift**: Stores global API configuration such as base URLs, default headers, and token management.
     - **APIParser.swift**: Handles parsing raw API responses (e.g., JSON or XML) into usable models or error states.
   - **When to simplify**: For simpler apps, you might combine **APIRequest**, **APIParser**, and **APIConfiguration** into a single API class if the complexity doesn‚Äôt warrant separate files.

2. **/Services/**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains **business-critical services** that are essential for the app's functionality, such as user authentication, session management, or location services.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **AuthService.swift**: Handles user authentication logic (e.g., login, logout, token refresh).
     - **SessionManager.swift**: Manages user sessions, handling token storage, expiration checks, and user state.
     - **LocationService.swift**: Manages the collection and processing of location data, using services like `CoreLocation`.
   - **When to simplify**: If your app only has one or two core services, you might consolidate them into a single **Services.swift** file to reduce file bloat.

3. **/Repositories/**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages **data retrieval and persistence**, abstracting the underlying data sources (e.g., APIs, databases) from the app‚Äôs business logic. Repositories provide a clear interface for the app to fetch, store, or update data.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **UserRepository.swift**: Provides an abstraction over user-related data, handling operations like user creation, retrieval, and updates.
     - **ProductRepository.swift**: Manages data access related to products, such as fetching product details, searching products, or storing product information.
   - **When to simplify**: For smaller apps that only interact with one type of data source (e.g., an API), you may not need separate repositories. Instead, data-fetching logic could be integrated directly into services under **API** or **Data**.

4. **/Model/**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores **data models** that represent the core entities in the app, such as users, products, and orders. These models are typically **business-critical** and serve as the foundation of your app‚Äôs data structures.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **User.swift**: The data model for user-related information.
     - **Product.swift**: The data model for representing a product.
     - **Order.swift**: Represents orders or transactions in the app.
   - **When to simplify**: If your app has very few models, you can group all models into a single **Models.swift** file rather than splitting them into individual files.

5. **/LocalData/**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains logic for managing **local persistence**, including databases (e.g., CoreData) and caching strategies for offline storage or performance improvement.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **CoreDataManager.swift**: Manages CoreData stack setup, CRUD operations, and context handling.
     - **CoreDataMigrations.swift**: Handles database migrations in CoreData.
     - **DiskCache.swift**: Implements disk-based caching for storing large files or frequently used data.
     - **MemoryCache.swift**: Implements in-memory caching to speed up access to data that is fetched repeatedly.
   - **When to simplify**: If the app only uses one form of local persistence (e.g., just CoreData), you may not need separate caching files or **Database** folders.

### **/Domain/**

The **Domain** folder contains the **business logic** of the app, including domain-specific models, mappers, and repositories. This folder isolates how core entities in your app‚Äîlike users or products‚Äîare managed, separated from the data handling in the **Data** folder. It defines the **rules, processes, and workflows** that drive the app‚Äôs behavior.

#### **Breakdown**:
```
/Domain/
    /Model/
        User.swift
        Product.swift
        Order.swift
    /Mappers/
        UserMapper.swift
        ProductMapper.swift
    /Repositories/
        UserRepository.swift
        ProductRepository.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **/Model/**:
   - **Purpose**: Represents **domain-specific models**, which reflect the business logic of your app. These models define how core entities (like users, orders, products) are structured and managed.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **User.swift**: Defines the user data model, including business-specific attributes (e.g., account types, roles).
     - **Product.swift**: Represents a product entity with business-specific attributes like pricing, availability, or categories.
     - **Order.swift**: Manages order data, including relationships between users and products, order status, etc.

2. **/Mappers/**:
   - **Purpose**: Converts **data models** (e.g., API models) into **domain models** or vice versa. This layer ensures that the domain models used in business logic are decoupled from the underlying data representation (e.g., from the API or database).
   - **What goes here**:
     - **UserMapper.swift**: Converts API or database representations of a user into a domain model.
     - **ProductMapper.swift**: Converts product data between API, persistence, and domain layers.

3. **/Repositories/**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides an abstraction over the **domain‚Äôs business logic** and ensures that data access (e.g., reading or writing data) is centralized and decoupled from the rest of the app.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **UserRepository.swift**: Interfaces with services or data sources to provide business-specific data access for users.
     - **ProductRepository.swift**: Manages the data access logic for products.

### **/Utils/**

The **Utils** folder contains general-purpose **utility classes, extensions, and helpers** that are shared across the app. These utilities provide common functionality but aren‚Äôt tied to any specific feature or business logic. They improve the maintainability of your app by abstracting away repetitive code.

#### **Breakdown**:
```plaintext
/Utils/
    /Extensions/
        StringExtensions.swift
        DateExtensions.swift
    /Helpers/
        ErrorHandler.swift
        DateFormatterHelper.swift
    /Formatters/
        CurrencyFormatter.swift
        NumberFormatter.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **/Extensions/**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores extensions that add methods to Swift‚Äôs built-in types or UIKit components to simplify repetitive tasks.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **StringExtensions.swift**: Provides utilities for string operations like trimming whitespace, validating email addresses, or formatting phone numbers.
     - **DateExtensions.swift**: Adds functionality to the `Date` type, such as calculating differences between dates or converting to strings.

2. **/Helpers/**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains utility classes that help with common tasks like error handling, date formatting, or file operations.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **ErrorHandler.swift**: Centralized error handling logic, such as logging errors or displaying error messages.
     - **DateFormatterHelper.swift**: A helper class that ensures consistent date formatting across the app.

3. **/Formatters/**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains reusable **formatting logic** for presenting data, such as currency values or numbers.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **CurrencyFormatter.swift**: Formats currency values in a localized format.
     - **NumberFormatter.swift**: Formats numbers (e.g., decimals, percentages) based on user locale or business requirements.

### **/Config/**

The **Config** folder stores **app-wide configuration** and **environment-specific settings**. This folder includes settings like API keys, base URLs, and environment-specific configurations (e.g., for development, staging, production). Centralizing this logic ensures that environment changes are easy to manage without affecting the app‚Äôs core logic.

#### **Breakdown**:
```
/Config/
    /Environments/
        Development.xcconfig
        Staging.xcconfig
        Production.xcconfig
    /FeatureFlags/
        FeatureFlagManager.swift
        FeatureToggles.swift
    /AppSettings/
        AppSettingsManager.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **/Environments/**:
   - **Purpose**: Stores environment-specific configuration files, managing settings for development, staging, and production environments.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **Development.xcconfig**: Config file for the development environment.
     - **Staging.xcconfig**: Config file for the staging environment.
     - **Production.xcconfig**: Config file for the production environment.

2. **/FeatureFlags/**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains logic for managing **feature flags**, which allow features to be toggled on or off across different environments.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **FeatureFlagManager.swift**: Manages the logic for enabling or disabling features based on configuration settings.
     - **FeatureToggles.swift**: Stores the actual feature flags and their states (enabled/disabled).

3. **/AppSettings/**:
   - **Purpose**: Centralized management of **app-wide settings**, such as user preferences, theme settings, or notification settings.
   - **What goes here**:
     - **AppSettingsManager.swift**: A class that manages app-wide settings (e.g., dark mode, language preferences).

### **/AppServices/**

The **AppServices** folder houses **app-wide services** that manage critical background processes or system interactions. These services are used throughout the app but are not tied to specific features.

#### **Breakdown**:
```plaintext
/AppServices/
    SessionService.swift
    AuthService.swift
    PushNotificationService.swift
    PermissionsService.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **SessionService.swift**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages the user‚Äôs session, including login state, token storage, and session expiration.
   - **What goes here**: Logic for persisting, updating, and invalidating user sessions.

2. **AuthService.swift**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles **user authentication**, including login, logout, and token management.
   - **What goes here**: Logic for authenticating users, refreshing tokens, and logging out.

3. **PushNotificationService.swift**:

   - **What goes here**: Logic for registering devices with the push notification service and managing notification actions.

4. **PermissionsService.swift**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages app permissions for accessing device services like location, camera, and notifications.
   - **What goes here**: Logic for requesting, checking, and managing user permissions.

## **/Shared/**

The **Shared** folder contains reusable components, extensions, utilities, and helpers that are **not tied to specific business logic** but are used across multiple features or modules of the app. The purpose of this folder is to centralize **common, reusable functionality**, ensuring that the codebase is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easy to maintain.

Unlike **Core**, which houses critical, business-centric logic, **Shared** focuses on **general-purpose tools and utilities** that support the development process across the entire app.

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the **Shared** folder and explains what kinds of components belong here and how they should be structured.

#### **Best Practices for Shared Folder**

- **Decoupled from Business Logic**: Ensure that the **Shared** folder only contains **generic** components that do not depend on business logic or app-specific domains. Anything tied to business logic should live in the **Core** folder.
  
- **Avoid Over-Nesting**: Keep the folder structure relatively flat. Avoid creating deep folder hierarchies, which can lead to complexity and make components harder to find.

- **Organized by Functionality**: Group reusable components by their function (e.g., **Helpers**, **Views**, **Utilities**) to ensure the organization is intuitive for any developer working on the project.

- **Feature-Agnostic**: Components in **Shared** should not depend on any feature-specific logic. For example, a **CustomButton** should be customizable for different contexts without being tied to a specific screen or feature.

- **Be Consistent**: Ensure that naming conventions and file structure in **Shared** are consistent with the rest of the project. This consistency makes it easier to navigate and reuse components across the app.

### **/Components/**

The **Components** folder contains **reusable UI elements** that can be shared across various views or features in the app. These components are typically generic and customizable, making them flexible for use across different parts of the app.

#### **Breakdown**:
```plaintext
/Components/
    CustomButton.swift
    RoundedTextField.swift
    LoadingSpinner.swift
```

#### **Explanation**:

1. **CustomButton.swift**:
   - **Purpose**: A customizable button component that can be reused in multiple views throughout the app, featuring consistent styling and behavior.
   - **What goes here**: Logic for button appearance (e.g., rounded corners, shadows) and interactions (e.g., animations on tap, custom actions).

2. **RoundedTextField.swift**:
   - **Purpose**: A reusable input field with rounded edges that can be used in various forms, from login screens to search bars.
   - **What goes here**: Customizable properties like border styles, placeholder text configuration, and validation methods.
