# Reverse the Words in a String

## Problem Description
Write a function that returns a string with each of its words reversed but in the original order, without using a loop.

## Input
- A single string.

## Output
- A string with words in the same order but with the letters in each word reversed.

## Constraints
- The function should not use a `for` loop.

## Example
> **Input:**  
> "Swift Coding Challenges"  
>
> **Output:**  
> "tfiwS gnidoC segnellahC"  
>
> **Explanation:**  
> The words "Swift", "Coding", and "Challenges" are reversed individually to "tfiwS", "gnidoC", and "segnellahC" respectively, but remain in the same order.

> **Input:**  
> "The quick brown fox"  
>
> **Output:**  
> "ehT kciuq nworb xof"  
>
> **Explanation:**  
> The words "The", "quick", "brown", and "fox" are reversed individually to "ehT", "kciuq", "nworb", and "xof" respectively, but remain in the same order.
