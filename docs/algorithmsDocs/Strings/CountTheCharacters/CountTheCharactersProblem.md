# Count the Characters

## Problem Description
Write a function that accepts a string and a character, and returns the number of times the specific character appears in the string, taking case into account. 

Tip: If you can solve this without using a `for-in` loop, you can consider it a tricky challenge.

## Input
- A string.
- A single character.

## Output
- An integer representing the number of times the specified character appears in the input string.

## Constraints
- The function should take case into account (e.g., 'a' is different from 'A').

## Example

> "The rain in Spain"  
> Character: "a"

> **Input:**  
> "Mississippi"  
> Character: "i"  
>
> **Output:**  
> 4  
>
> **Explanation:**  
> The character 'i' appears 4 times in the string.

> **Input:**  
> "Hacking with Swift"
